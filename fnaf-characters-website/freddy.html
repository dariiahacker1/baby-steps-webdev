    Freddy Fazbear is the main character and the main antagonist, and at the same time the symbol of the Five Nights at
    Freddy's game series. Freddy is an animatronic bear that is in the "Free Roaming" mode during the night, along with
    other animatronics.

    He wears a black bow tie and a top hat of the same color, and holds a microphone in his right paw. His ears are
    arranged in such a way that he can move them back and forth (this was shown in the game's trailer). Unlike other
    animatronics, only his eyes are visible on the cameras, which glow (but the whole body can be seen when
    illuminated). He has palm prints on his face, which can be seen in the game if you look closely. His eyes are
    blue-blue, but he always looks at the camera with his real, endoskeletal eyes.

    Freddy's appearance has changed a lot in the second part of the game. Many parameters have changed - buttons have
    been added to his chest, gloves on his hands have become more visible. His body segments have also become smaller,
    and his top hat has become removable. This time, Freddy has an upper row of teeth, his head looks a little smaller,
    the mustache marks are gone, his eyebrows are thinner, his upper lip has a deeper gap in the center. The eyes were
    probably also deeper in the mask. Externally, Freddy is better preserved than other old animatronics and Mangles:
    his skin only shows holes and wires protruding from them in places, but he is just as dirty as other old
    animatronics. These changes are probably the original appearance of this animatronic.

            Freddy was originally designed to be stationary and move only when the player lost all energy
            during the night. However, Scott wanted to pay more attention to the main character and changed his artificial
            intelligence, after which Freddy began to chase the player from the third night.

        <li class="ol" type="1">In the book Five Nights at Freddy's: The Twisted Ones says that Freddy's name is John.
        </li>
        <li class="ol" type="1"> Freddy has a counterpart known as Golden Freddy. It is not known whether this is an old version of the costume or a
            a ghost. It is believed that Golden Freddy is a hallucination of Mike Schmidt, but this is refuted by the fact that Jeremy and
            Fritz also see him. Most likely, he is a ghost (which explains why all the guards see him).

        <li class="ol" type="1"> Freddy appears with human eyes in hallucinations, while Bonnie appears with her
            endoskeleton or without eyes.

        </li>
        <li class="ol" type="1">Freddie's tune can be heard in a phone call at four in the morning. It is obvious that
            Freddy may have been involved in the death of the guy on the phone, as seen in the fingerprints on his face, but he can also
            playing the same tune in the kitchen. Besides, the guy on the phone could have fought back.
        </li>
        <li class="ol" type="1"> The explanation for Freddie's lack of movement in the first two nights may be that he is studying your
            strategy.
