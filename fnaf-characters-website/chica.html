<p class="osnova">Chika is a yellow anthropomorphic animatronic chicken. The character's body consists of a matte
    fabric skin covered with dark stained areas.
    Chika has a rounded head shaped like an apple. On the top of her head is a bunch of three small
    drop-shaped fragments, widened towards the top, imitating feathers.

    On the face of the chicken there are two, far apart, round openings of the eye sockets, inside which are deeply set
    round
    eyes with a purple iris and three decorative white dots of light glare, framed by glossy black
    metal eyelids. Above the eye sockets, the animatronic has flat, arched eyebrows that widen toward the center.
    Below, in the middle of the antagonist's face, there is a bulky oval upper half of an orange beak
    pyramidal in shape, with a rounded edge and two slits at the base.
    <img class="imgchica2" src="img/Chica_Official_Render.webp" alt="">
    Under the upper part of the beak is its trapezoidal lower half, rounded in shape. On the inner
    edge of the lower fragment are ten smoothed white parallelepiped teeth with a large gap in the
    in the middle.

    Chika's head is connected to the torso by two metal bayonets of the endoskeleton neck with curved
    metal cables and rods.
    Chika is a restored analog of its Broken version, which was restored and put to use after
    animators of the Toy Line were sent for disposal due to a malfunction. Chika is possessed by the spirit of a girl
    named Susie,
    whom William Afton, along with 3 other children, killed in the first Freddy Fusber's Pizza.

<h1 class="kursiv wow"> Chika has several variations that appear on the map depending on the player's level. Although
    these versions are not
    distinguishable in the pre-fight menu, they can be seen during gameplay:</h1>
