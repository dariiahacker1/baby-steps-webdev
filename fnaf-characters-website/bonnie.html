<p class="osnovabonnie">Bonnie the Rabbit, also known as Bonnie the Bunny and The Bunny
    - is a minor antagonist of the first part of Five Nights at Freddy's and one of the antagonists of the second part.
    Purple
    is an animatronic rabbit with a red bow tie. Just like his fellow animatronics, Freddy and Chick (and formerly
    Foxy),
    Bonnie is a friendly children's entertainer during the day and kills any human he sees during the night,
    including Mike Schmidt, the mysterious protagonist.

    Bonnie is a lilac-colored animatronic rabbit with long ears. He plays a red bass guitar in the restaurant. His
    body, except for his head, is identical to Freddy's, but has a different color, and he also wears a red bow tie.
    This version
    Bonnie has no upper teeth.
    The second part of Bonnie has a slightly different design, and it is also heavily damaged. Like Freddy, he has two
    buttons on his chest. Bonnie's upper face and left hand are missing. The covering on his right hand and left
    feet have come off. His lower body has become much larger than his upper body, and he has become somewhat
    more massive. His chin does not reach his tie.
    During the day, Bonnie appears as a friendly, harmless, joyful, sweet and cute robot that never harms children, in
    the
    Freddie plays guitar in the gang; although his appearance is somewhat disturbing, her behavior when confronted by
    adults is malicious.

    As soon as he encounters the night guard, Bonnie transforms into a cunning, vicious, ruthless, malicious
    impatient murderous stalker, obsessed with trapping the protagonist in a suit like an endoskeleton.
    Bonnie is the smartest and second most dangerous of the animatronics, after Foxy. He doesn't wait long outside the
    door, but if
    not too far away, he can reach his destination unexpectedly quickly. Unlike the persistent Chicky, Bonnie does not
    will not stand in front of a closed door for a long time. He is also the first to leave the stage.
    Bonnie is known for being one of the most active animatronics in the game (but not on the first night). He always
    walks to the left.
    When he reaches the office, he appears in the left doorway (unlike Chicky, who goes to the right).

    He has the ability to turn off the cameras when he moves to another room, just like Chicky and Freddy.

    Sometimes, if you look at him while he's on stage, he won't move. That's one of the best ways to
    to get through the first two nights. However, this method may not work because Bonnie knows how to turn off the
    cameras.

    <li class="textspiska">Scott created Bonnie's model in just one day by modifying Freddy Fazbear's model.</li>
    <li class="textspiska">Bonnie appeared in Scott's dreams multiple times.</li>
    <li class="textspiska">Bonnie is Scott's favorite character, inspired by a blue rabbit named Cherry that Scott had.</li>
